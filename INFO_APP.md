# Russian Food Recognition

This repository provides a robust framework for recognizing various Russian dishes using the Faster R-CNN and SSD deep learning architectures. This project aims to assist in the automatic identification and categorization of Russian cuisine in images, which can be applied in diverse domains such as food blogging, dietary tracking, and restaurant automation.

## Overview

The Russian Food Recognition project leverages the Faster R-CNN and SSD models to detect and classify different types of Russian food in images. Faster R-CNN is a state-of-the-art object detection model that provides high accuracy and speed, making it suitable for real-time food recognition applications.

## Dataset

The dataset on [HF](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mllab/alfafood) and on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfclabber/alfafood) in compressed image format used for training consists of a variety of images representing different Russian dishes. Each image is annotated with bounding boxes and labels corresponding to the food items present.
